# fo2rist.com self-hosted content including T-Kittens podcast

My personal non-engineering projects: blog, podcast.

**Subfolders**:
- [`t-kittens_website`](./t-kittens_website/README.md) - [t-kittens.fo2rist.com](http://t-kittens.fo2rist.com)
- [`t-kittens_podcast_automation`](./t-kittens_podcast_automation/README.md) - scripts for automated audio production

The rest of [fo2rist.com](http://fo2rist.com) is not self-hosted and linked to the 3rd party services like medium instead.
